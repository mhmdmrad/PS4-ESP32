# PS4-ESP32
This project connects a PS4 DualShock controller to an ESP32 via Bluetooth, allowing wireless control of robots, motors, or home automation. The ESP32 reads joystick, button, and trigger inputs to execute commands in real time. Ideal for robotics, gaming, and IoT applications with minimal hardware.
